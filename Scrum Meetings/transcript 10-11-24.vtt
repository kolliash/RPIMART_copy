1 "Lee, Isaac" (1706536704)
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.030
Alright, so I'm recording now. I guess I can start with what I've done, which is I've finished making, my SQL tables to store user information and their history, and I've made a PHP webpage that can.

2 "Lee, Isaac" (1706536704)
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:37.457
Read that data and display it. So now I'm in the process of taking the work I've done building websites, reading Json and like those HTML elements and just carrying them over to that webpage in order to display it using mysql.

3 "Ashrita" (2048335616)
00:00:37.457 --> 00:00:44.618
Okay, that's cool. And do you know if, like, we'll be able to open those P.

4 "Lee, Isaac" (1706536704)
00:00:44.618 --> 00:01:11.377
HP tables or NO? You will. I should just like post the, information on how to log into phpm admin. It's literally just username. Yeah, I'll type it in now, but the username is phpm admin, the password is PHPM admin. Probably sometime in the future we'll need to change that.

5 "Ashrita" (2048335616)
00:01:11.377 --> 00:01:17.680
But I figured I'd just keep it simple for now. Yeah, that's good. And is this for like the users to sign?

6 "Lee, Isaac" (1706536704)
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:30.833
Then or this is for like the listings part of it. This is for the users, but because it's just one PHP man thing and figured there'll be like a user database and a listings database and it'll go.

7 "Ashrita" (2048335616)
00:01:30.833 --> 00:01:45.218
With use the same like yeah ok yeah so when we want another one, we can just add a new database and tables in there. Okay. Yeah. Okay.

8 "Lee, Isaac" (1706536704)
00:01:45.218 --> 00:01:49.487
Is that it? That's it for me.

9 "Mall, Nayib Roshan" (891369216)
00:01:49.487 --> 00:02:04.951
Anything else? Okay, I guess, yeah, I just finished homepage, I've gotta copy and paste the bootstrap now then it's all I did so far. I haven't done that too much So yeah.

10 "Lee, Isaac" (1706536704)
00:02:04.951 --> 00:02:08.905
Oh. All right.

11 "Mall, Nayib Roshan" (891369216)
00:02:08.905 --> 00:02:11.052
Okay.

12 "Ashrita" (2048335616)
00:02:11.052 --> 00:02:26.100
So what do I do next, I think. I also added a logo to the nas bar, so if I think I, I requested you guys to merge the pull requests so if you do that, you should be able to see it.

13 "Ashrita" (2048335616)
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:46.100
And then I also created a listings form, so, I didn't like UCSS or anything. I just created like the basic template of the form, so the users can add their name, their email, and the information about the item, which is just the, the name, the price and the description, and then there's like a select an image button so they can.

14 "Ashrita" (2048335616)
00:02:46.100 --> 00:03:03.880
Can choose a file from their computer to select an image that they wanna upload, and then they can submit that. And right now it's just once you submit it, it's just displaying it to the HTML, but I think once I log into the PHP I'll create a database. So when you click submit, it'll add it to.

15 "Lee, Isaac" (1706536704)
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:25.946
A PHP database, but I'll do that before next meeting. Alright, and I think we might need to have maybe an in person meeting so that we can coordinate our usage of the databases unless people just feel like it's not a big deal to just.

16 "Ashrita" (2048335616)
00:03:25.946 --> 00:03:34.998
Use their own projects for everything. Yeah, I think we should have at least one, like, kind of soon just so we can sort everything out cause I feel like we get more.

17 "Lee, Isaac" (1706536704)
00:03:34.998 --> 00:03:36.375
Our work done when we're like working.

00:04:40.168 --> 00:04:46.494

29 "Ashrita" (2048335616)
00:04:46.494 --> 00:05:05.927

32 "Lee, Isaac" (1706536704)
00:05:10.311 --> 00:05:14.472
