malln2-pagination:
I implemented a dynamic pagination system for our website to enhance usability and improve the browsing experience. This system ensures that only 16 listings are displayed per page, keeping the layout clean and user-friendly.The users can press the "Next" and "Previous" button to move between pages or they can just click on the page number directly. The pages are created dynamically so the number of pages is based off the number of listings that are created. Also the user knows what page they are on because the active page is highlighted as well. This was done by adding html into the code as well as using JavaScript. I stored all the existing elements into an array and looped through the array and calculate the starting and ending index so it can display the correct amount of listings. The code loops through the array and dynamically generates the HTML to display them.

malln2-Homepage:
For the hompage I created the layout and basic structure of the page such as the description, color scheme, and the "Top Picks" section. Later throughout the project one of my teammates enhanced the platform by incorporating Bootstrap which improved the design.

malln2-navbarfix:
For the navbar I had to fix an issue where sections of the website were being underlined even when they were not on the homepage. So I fixed this so that only the acticve page is being underlined. I did this by dynamically applying the "active" class to the current link based on the page the user is on. This was accomplished using JavaScript by first creating a function to remove the "active" class from all links. Then I created another function that checks the current page and adds the "active" class to the link that matches, highlighting the correct page.

malln2-accountpage:
For the account page I focused on creating the CSS styling to enhance the appearance.I designed it in a way where it was clean and simple so the user can navigate easily. I also followed the Laws of UX when designing this aswell such as Fitt's Law when making the buttons and Hick's Law by limiting decisions.

malln2-listingcss:
For the listing css so when a user clicks on a listing they are met with the listing where the left section of the container is the image while the right-hand side contains the item details and price. Towards the bottom of the listing there is a section for the sellers detail where it shows the sellers name and email. I followed the Honeycomb Model and Laws of UX closely while designing this such as being accesible to anyone using it by using large fonts and a good color scheme. Additionally, I focused on making the page visually appealing to enhance its desirability.
