### Search Bar (sridhs2---Search-Bar)

- Created a search bar in the loadphp.js file.
- Created 2 key arrays where it would dynamically update the other list to display. 

### Tagging/Filter System (sridhs2---TaggingSystem)

- Implemented the frontend portion for the form.
- It allows you to dynamically remove or add tags to the form

### Transaction-History (sridhs2---Transaction-History)

- Initially started working on transaction history where it would take 2 users upon accpeting 
request in inbox.
- Too much work for little time, so ended up creating a new file to display all listings that 
user made.

### Back Button (sridhs2---backbutton)

- Made a back button on each item listing.
- When back button is clicked, it takes you back to the previous page.
- Slight bug: since the js page takes you to the last loaded page, if you directly go to a
listing page and click back, it takes you to the last loaded page which may not be rpimart.

### Navigation Bar (sridhs2---BS-NavBar)

Approximate Time Range (Sept 17th - Oct 9th)

What I did:
- Created the navigation bar using bootstrap css and js.
- In order to avoid redundancy of code, I created a script that loads the navigation bar into 
other files.
- Also implemented profile on the side with dropdown (frontend).

### Sign-Up Page (sridhs2---SignUpPage)

- Created the front-end portion of the sign up page.
- Used boostrap tools for this.
- Added web layer for textured background.
- Also implemented animated form changing upon requesting either register to login or
login to register.

### Home Page (malln2-HomePage)

- I took whatever Nayib had with the basic css and modified it to use bootstrap tools in order
to match the aesthetic of the navigation bar I created. Kept majority HTML the same.
- Also created the top picks form using key frames and animations and other bootstrap tools to
create somewhat of a rotating rainbow aesthetic in order to emphasize importance/popularity.

### Page pagination (malln2-pagination)

- Given what Nayib implemented for the pagination on frontend, I completely changed the loadphp.js
structure to get a semi-working pagination structure. Issue with display with items needing to be
in 4 by 4 grid with 16 items but displayed 5 by 5 grid with 16 items.

### Maps API (sharpq-Maps2)

- Implemented working map implementation underneath each listing.
- This includes:
- Taking the locations from the form input.
- Assigning predefined coordinates to each location.
- Using Google API tools to display location on map underneath the item.
