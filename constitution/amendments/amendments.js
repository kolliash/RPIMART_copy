    1: "Analysis:<br>The First Amendment, a cornerstone of the United States, safeguards individuals' right to practice their religion and express their views publicly. It also protects freedoms of speech, press, peaceable assembly, and petition to the government. This part is highly relevant today, as ongoing debates question the boundaries of freedom of speech. The most controversial issue is whether hate speech can be restricted when freedom of speech is constitutionally guaranteed. While diverse views exist, I believe that the essence of America is not to harm others intentionally; hence, the Constitution should not protect hate speech. <br><br>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.",
    2: "Analysis:<br>The Second Amendment holds personal significance for many across the nation. It is believed that the right to bear arms empowers each citizen to defend themselves. However, concerns about gun violence persist. This debate, one that has divided America, is of particular interest in the wake of the 2024 elections, as it will shape the future of this issue.<br><br>A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.",
    3: "Analysis:<br> The Third Amendment is significant in the history of the United States, particularly during the Revolutionary War. It prohibited the forced quartering of soldiers in private homes, safeguarding individual rights and reflecting the triumphs of American history. <br><br>No Soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the Owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law.    ",
    4: "Analysis:<br>The Fourth Amendment protects individuals' rights to their belongings and prohibits searches without a warrant. This amendment has led to some interesting Supreme Court cases, such as New Jersey v. TLO. In this case, a student was found with marijuana in her purse, and she argued that the school principal's search violated her Fourth Amendment rights. However, the Supreme Court ruled that the school authorities were justified in searching her due to reasonable suspicion and the need to maintain a safe school environment.  <br><br>The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.    ",
    5: "Analysis:<br> The phrase ‘I plead the fifth’ is often recognized in movies but represents more than just a dramatic line. It refers to the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution, which grants individuals the right to refuse to answer questions that may incriminate them. This protection is commonly known even among those unfamiliar with legal terminology. <br><br>No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.    ",
    6: "Analysis:<br>The Sixth Amendment is a crucial component of the United States' legal system, serving as its backbone. This system has played a key role in safeguarding the rights of the innocent while ensuring the conviction of the guilty. While some critics argue that the legal system is flawed, citing issues such as racial and class disparities, it's important to acknowledge the ongoing efforts to establish an impartial court system in the country.  <br><br>In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.    ",
    7: "Analysis:<br> The Seventh Amendment ensures that citizens have the right to a trial by jury in federal courts for civil cases involving claims that exceed a certain dollar value. <br><br>In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.    ",
    8: "Analysis:<br>The Eighth Amendment serves to protect individuals from cruel and unusual punishment for their crimes. This raises the question of why individuals who have committed inhumane crimes should be treated with humanity. One possible explanation is rooted in the fundamental belief that upholding order and treating each other properly requires people to do the right thing. <br><br>Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.    ",
    9: "Analysis:<br>The ninth amendment restated that nobody who is an American citizen will ever lose their right listed in the constitution. This amendment was a response to fears that by listing specific rights in the Constitution, other rights not mentioned might be overlooked or denied. The ninth amendment was included to reassure the people that their rights were not limited to those explicitly stated in the Constitution. <br><br>The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.    ",
    10: "Analysis:<br>The Tenth Amendment was crucial to America's creation, a value that the founding fathers believed to be extremely important. They wanted to properly establish the division of power between the federal and state governments. This amendment establishes how the division works and specifies which powers are given to whom. <br><br>The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.    ",
    11: "Analysis:<br>This amendment asserts that states cannot be sued in a federal court by their own citizens. This principle is called state sovereign immunity. This protects states from a lot of legal proceedings in other foreign states' domestic courts. <br><br>The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.    ",
    12: "Analysis:<br>The Twelfth Amendment outlines how Presidents and Vice Presidents are elected. It works with the country's electoral college and explicitly states how that process occurs.<br><br>The Electors shall meet in their respective states and vote by ballot for President and Vice President, one of whom, at least, shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves; they shall name in their ballots the person voted for as President, and in distinct ballots the person voted for as Vice President, and they shall make distinct lists of all persons voted for as President, and of all persons voted for as Vice President, and of the number of votes for each, which lists they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States, directed to the President of the Senate; the President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the certificates and the votes shall then be counted; The person having the greatest number of votes for President, shall be the President, if such number be a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed; and if no person have such majority, then from the persons having the highest numbers not exceeding three on the list of those voted for as President, the House of Representatives shall choose immediately, by ballot, the President. But in choosing the President, the votes shall be taken by states, the representation from each state having one vote; a quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states, and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice. And if the House of Representatives shall not choose a President whenever the right of choice shall devolve upon them, before the fourth day of March next following, then the Vice President shall act as President, as in case of the death or other constitutional disability of the President. The person having the greatest number of votes as Vice President, shall be the Vice President, if such number be a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed, and if no person have a majority, then from the two highest numbers on the list, the Senate shall choose the Vice President; a quorum for the purpose shall consist of two thirds of the whole number of Senators, and a majority of the whole number shall be necessary to a choice. But no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice President of the United States. ",
    13: "Analysis:<br>In 1865, the 13th amendment was passed, abolishing slavery across the entire country. This was one of the defining moments for America, as it signified the end of the Civil War and freed almost 4 million slaves. This amendment changed America's history forever and continues to be taught as immensely important for shaping this country.<br><br>Section 1<br><br>Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.<br><br>Section 2<br><br>Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.",
    14: "Analysis:<br>This amendment established the rule of birthright citizenship in the United States, which was intended to give African Americans the full rights and protections of the Constitution. Section 2 says that government representatives will be sent to count the number of people within each state, and repression of any man's right to vote except for rebellion or criminality would result in the state losing Congressional representation. Section 3 places restrictions on the ability for people who held public office before joining the Confederacy to rejoin public office without a vote from Congress giving permission. Finally, Section 4 establishes that the public debt incurred from fighting in the Civil War was legitimate, and the debt incurred by the Confederacy was illegitimate and void. The section also states that former slave owners would not be reimbursed for the loss of their slaves. Section 5 enables Congress to enforce the previous sections.<br><br>Section 1<br>All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.<br><br>Section 2<br>Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed. But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice-President of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the Executive and Judicial officers of a State, or the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion, or other crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.<br><br>Section 3<br>No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.<br><br>Section 4<br>The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned. But neither the United States nor any State shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave; but all such debts, obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void.<br><br>Section 5<br>The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.",
    15: "Analysis:<br>Along with the 13th and 14th Amendments, this amendment was ratified in the Reconstruction Era to protect the rights of the newly freed African Americans. This amendment enfranchised African American men, however, following the collapse of Reconstruction, many states created new barriers for African Americans to vote by indirectly targeting the black population through measures such as literacy tests and poll taxes, which were later outlawed in the 24th Amendment. These measures were enabled by the Supreme Court, which gave a very narrow interpretation of the amendment until later in the 20th century.<br><br>Section 1<br>The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.<br><br>Section 2<br>The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.",
    16: "Analysis:<br>After federal income tax was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in the 1895 case Pollock v. Farmers' Loan and Trust Company, the US federal government was unable to levy income taxes. The federal government had formerly gained most of its income from tariffs; however, many believed that this practice gave poor Americans an excess burden in funding the government. Progressives were able to garner the support necessary to add the 16th Amendment to the Constitution in order to enable income taxes that they believed would more fairly spread the burden to fund the federal government.<br><br>The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.",
    17: "Analysis:<br>Before this amendment, the state legislatures had been in charge of determining who would represent the state in the Senate. This led to issues, such as accusations of corruption, deadlocks among legislatures who couldn't agree on who to delegate, and turnover caused by frequent changes in state politics. Some conservative scholars argue that this amendment undermines the balance of power between the state and federal governments laid out by the Constitution by taking away the state governments' ability to choose their delegates for Congress.<br><br>The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, elected by the people thereof, for six years; and each Senator shall have one vote. The electors in each State shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislatures.<br><br>When vacancies happen in the representation of any State in the Senate, the executive authority of such State shall issue writs of election to fill such vacancies: Provided, That the legislature of any State may empower the executive thereof to make temporary appointments until the people fill the vacancies by election as the legislature may direct.<br><br>This amendment shall not be so construed as to affect the election or term of any Senator chosen before it becomes valid as part of the Constitution.",
    18: "Analysis:<br>The temperance movement arose from the anger towards alcohol's effect on society. Most organized prohibition groups were religious organizations who blamed alcohol for poverty, immorality, violence, and other problems. The groups gained power and authority through their campaigning, and in 1917 the amendment passed the resolution to begin the ratification of the amendment. In 1919, the amendment was officially ratified. Congress then passed the Volstead Act in order to outline the prohibition of alcohol. This amendment was later overturned by the 21st Amendment after prohibition backfired in many ways, and so it is no longer a relevant part of the Constitution for judicial decisions.<br><br>Section 1<br>After one year from the ratification of this article the manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors within, the importation thereof into, or the exportation thereof from the United States and all territory subject to the jurisdiction thereof for beverage purposes is hereby prohibited.<br><br>Section 2<br>The Congress and the several States shall have concurrent power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.<br><br>Section 3<br>This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of the several States, as provided in the Constitution, within seven years from the date of the submission hereof to the States by the Congress.",
    19: "Analysis:<br>Women's rights to vote had been suppressed in the United States from the start of the country. Movements to grant suffrage to women quickly arose, and in 1848 the Seneca Falls Convention started the women's rights movement to give women suffrage. Many suffrage organizations arose, with many different tactics, including arguing that the Constitution protected women's right to vote, however they were denied by the Supreme Court. Over time, the movement managed to sway public opinion, and the amendment gained the support of both parties as well as President Woodrow Wilson. The amendment passed the House but narrowly failed in the Senate in 1918, which led to the ousting of many Senators who voted against the amendment. The Amendment passed in the House and Senate in 1919 and was ratified in 1920 after Tennessee became the 36th state to ratify the amendment by one vote.<br><br>The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.<br><br>Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.",
    20: 'Analysis:<br>This Amendment, commonly referred to as the "lame duck amendment," was meant to fix a problem with the timing of when newly elected officials take powers. Before this amendment, the presidential term started on March 4th, and Congress would meet every year in December. This meant that the President would have a four-month period between being elected and taking power, and the new Congressional members could take a full year to take actions. This would lead to an awkward position where the people in power did not represent their constituents who voted for someone else, and their presence was referred to as a lame duck session until the person who was elected could take power. This amendment moved these dates so that the Congress and President would take power in January after their election, allowing the government to be run by the people voted on by the people. This amendment also specified that the Vice President would take over as President in the event that the President Elect dies.<br><br>Section 1<br>The terms of the President and the Vice President shall end at noon on the 20th day of January, and the terms of Senators and Representatives at noon on the 3rd day of January, of the years in which such terms would have ended if this article had not been ratified; and the terms of their successors shall then begin.<br><br>Section 2<br>The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year, and such meeting shall begin at noon on the 3rd day of January, unless they shall by law appoint a different day.<br><br>Section 3<br>If, at the time fixed for the beginning of the term of the President, the President elect shall have died, the Vice President elect shall become President. If a President shall not have been chosen before the time fixed for the beginning of his term, or if the President elect shall have failed to qualify, then the Vice President elect shall act as President until a President shall have qualified; and the Congress may by law provide for the case wherein neither a President elect nor a Vice President elect shall have qualified, declaring who shall then act as President, or the manner in which one who is to act shall be selected, and such person shall act accordingly until a President or Vice President shall have qualified.<br><br>Section 4<br>The Congress may by law provide for the case of the death of any of the persons from whom the House of Representatives may choose a President whenever the right of choice shall have devolved upon them, and for the case of the death of any of the persons from whom the Senate may choose a Vice President whenever the right of choice shall have devolved upon them.<br><br>Section 5<br>Sections 1 and 2 shall take effect on the 15th day of October following the ratification of this article.<br><br>Section 6<br>This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States within seven years from the date of its submission.',
    21: "Analysis:<br>This amendment repealed the 18th Amendment, which brought about the Prohibition Era. Following the growth of mob violence, corruption, moonshine, speakeasies, and more, it became clear that prohibition was a failure. Instead of lowering the consumption of alcohol and bolstering the moral fabric of the nation, the country had gone in the opposite direction to what the temperance movement had wanted. The amendment also made it easier for states to regulate alcohol, as the amendment did not give Americans a constitutional right to alcohol, only repealing the ban. The second section has been controversial due to its apparent contradictions with the Commerce Clause, Supremacy Clause, and Establishment Clause.<br><br>Section 1<br>The eighteenth article of amendment to the Constitution of the United States is hereby repealed.<br><br>Section 2<br>The transportation or importation into any State, Territory, or possession of the United States for delivery or use therein of intoxicating liquors, in violation of the laws thereof, is hereby prohibited.<br><br>Section 3<br>This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by conventions in the several States, as provided in the Constitution, within seven years from the date of the submission hereof to the States by the Congress.",
    22: "Analysis:<br>During the many conflicts of the 1930s and 1940s, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt became the man trusted to steer America into a better position. He won his third election in 1940, and his fourth in 1944, with his justification being the war in Europe being unprecedented and warranting a strong figure with an already functioning government. There were many concerns about how his presence could threaten American democracy, and soon after his death in 1945, the Republicans took control of the House and Senate in the 1946 election with a large part of their platform being an amendment to limit presidential terms.<br><br>Section 1<br>No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once. But this Article shall not apply to any person holding the office of President when this Article was proposed by the Congress, and shall not prevent any person who may be holding the office of President, or acting as President, during the term within which this Article becomes operative from holding the office of President or acting as President during the remainder of such term.<br><br>Section 2<br>This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States within seven years from the date of its submission to the States by the Congress.",
    23: "Analysis:<br>Because the District of Columbia is not a state, citizens of the territory historically were not able to vote in the presidential election. This amendment allowed the district to have voting rights that were no more than the least populous state. The District of Columbia has always voted for the Democratic candidate since the ratification of the Amendment in 1961. In the 2020 presidential election, the District of Columbia voted 92.15% for Joe Biden, giving Biden 3 electoral votes.<br><br>Section 1<br>The District constituting the seat of Government of the United States shall appoint in such manner as the Congress may direct: A number of electors of President and Vice President equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives in Congress to which the District would be entitled if it were a State, but in no event more than the least populous State; they shall be in addition to those appointed by the States, but they shall be considered, for the purposes of the election of President and Vice President, to be electors appointed by a State; and they shall meet in the District and perform such duties as provided by the twelfth article of amendment.<br><br>Section 2<br>The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.",
    24: 'Analysis:<br>Following the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments, many former Confederate states attempted to prevent African Americans from voting in their elections. One method that they used was "poll taxes," which forced citizens to pay a tax in order to vote. These laws were upheld by the Supreme Court in 1937, with a decision arguing that the laws were constitutional because states had the power to determine voter eligibility to vote as long as it was not done on the basis of race or sex. They also said that the taxes were applied to all voters equally, and so they did not illegally target specific groups of people. The 24th Amendment was proposed and ratified in the Civil Rights Era in 1964 in order to protect the voting rights of African Americans and the poor. The 1966 case Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections was the first Supreme Court ruling about poll taxes following the ratification of the amendment and resulted in the decision that poll taxes were unconstitutional in all governmental elections.<br><br>Section 1<br>The right of citizens of the United States to vote in any primary or other election for President or Vice President, for electors for President or Vice President, or for Senator or Representative in Congress, shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any State by reason of failure to pay any poll tax or other tax.<br><br>Section 2<br>The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.',
    25: "Analysis:<br>This Amendment has four different sections, all related to the Vice President and the transfer of power from President to Vice President.<br><br>Section 1 states that the Vice President would become the official President should the current President be removed from office for impeachment, death, or resignation. This was a change from the previous convention that the Vice President would only be considered the Acting President.<br><br>Section 2 states that the President must nominate a Vice President in the case of a vacancy in the office. Before this section, the Vice President position had remained empty until the next election. This section became very important during Richard Nixon's presidency, where Gerald Ford, who was appointed as Vice President after the resignation of his predecessor, became the President after Nixon's resignation following the Watergate scandal.<br><br>Section 3 lays out a guideline for the President to give a written declaration to the leaders of the House and Senate that they will be unable to perform their duties as President, giving their authority to the Vice President until submitting another written declaration to the contrary.<br><br>Section 4 allows the Vice President and a majority of an executive branch to inform the leaders of the House and Senate that the President is unable to perform their duties, which gives the Vice President the authority of the President. To return the power to the President, the President must then give the leaders of the House and Senate a written declaration that they are able to perform their duties, after which Congress will decide whether to accept this statement.<br><br>Section 1<br>In case of the removal of the President from office or of his death or resignation, the Vice President shall become President.<br><br>Section 2<br>Whenever there is a vacancy in the office of the Vice President, the President shall nominate a Vice President who shall take office upon confirmation by a majority vote of both Houses of Congress.<br><br>Section 3<br>Whenever the President transmits to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his written declaration that he is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, and until he transmits to them a written declaration to the contrary, such powers and duties shall be discharged by the Vice President as Acting President.<br><br>Section 4<br>Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President.<br><br>Thereafter, when the President transmits to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his written declaration that no inability exists, he shall resume the powers and duties of his office unless the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive department or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit within four days to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. Thereupon Congress shall decide the issue, assembling within forty-eight hours for that purpose if not in session. If the Congress, within twenty-one days after receipt of the latter written declaration, or, if Congress is not in session, within twenty-one days after Congress is required to assemble, determines by two-thirds vote of both Houses that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall continue to discharge the same as Acting President; otherwise, the President shall resume the powers and duties of his office.",
    26: "Analysis:<br>This amendment lowered the voting age for US citizens from 21 to 18. Historically, the age for voting was decided by the states, who collectively decided on 21 as the legal age. The move to lower the voting age had begun in the 1940s and gained momentum when President Eisenhower came out in support of giving 18-year-olds the right to vote. The Vietnam War in the 1960s caused many more people to advocate for the change, as people were upset that 18-year-olds who could not vote were being drafted into the war. Richard Nixon would ultimately amend the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to change the legal voting age to 18 for all US governmental elections, however, Oregon and Texas took this law to the Supreme Court and won, arguing that the federal government did not have the authority to decide the age to vote in local and state elections. Congress quickly created the 26th Amendment to give themselves the power to change the voting age nationwide.<br><br>Section 1<br>The right of citizens of the United States, who are eighteen years of age or older, to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of age.<br><br>Section 2<br>The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.",
    27: 'Analysis:<br>The 27th Amendment of the US Constitution was ratified in 1992. The act was first introduced in 1789, however, it did not ratify by enough states at the time. Because there are no expiration times for Constitutional Amendments, this amendment was technically still open to be ratified were it to get enough votes. Six states had voted for the amendment when it was first introduced, and Ohio joined them in 1873 after outrage at the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial Expenses Appropriation Act, known colloquially as the "Salary Grab Act", which passed earlier that year and greatly increased the salary of members of government, although it was soon rescinded. In 1978, Wyoming was the next state to ratify this Amendment, and shortly an undergraduate student at the University of Texas, Gregory Watson, began campaigning for the amendment to pass after writing a research paper arguing that the amendment could still be ratified. The campaign was ultimately successful, leading to the most recent ratification of a Constitutional Amendment.<br><br>No law, varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of Representatives shall have intervened.',
