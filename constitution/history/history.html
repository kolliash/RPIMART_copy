        The history of the Constitution can be traced back to September 17,
        1787. The founding fathers of the United States of America were
        entrusted with the crucial task of fixing the Articles of
        Confederation, the initial constitution established after the
        Revolutionary War in 1777. At that time, the Articles of Confederation
        had flaws that weakened the nation economically and led to conflicts
        among the states. Accordingly, a constitutional convention was
        convened in 1787 to address these issues. During this period, there
        was a strong sense of unity and purpose, as civil sessions were held
        to promote collaboration and improvement. Over 17 weeks, the
        participants worked tirelessly to devise a government system that
        ensured equality for all, now recognized as the checks and balances
        system.
