In this lab my group members and I split up the work and divided it out.

Annotations: I was tasked with annotating 13 of the amendments where I gave a translation of the amendments in simpler terms, references to important Supreme Court cases, or talked about the relevance of the amendment in our world today.

History.html:
I worked on the history page of the website where I researched about the history of the constitution and wrote a paragraph talking about it, giving a summary and a bit of background for the users of this website.

Resources used to research history:

https://supreme.findlaw.com/documents/consthist.html

https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/more-perfect-union

Home.html:
Worked on adding our group name and individual names to the home page of the website. Added the preamble.

Articles.html:
I worked on pasting the text from the constitution website and improving the formatting of the paragraphs for the articles. I had a lot of trouble trying to format the text for this in the js file. After trying to use p tags I realized that is not possible. After discussing how to fix this with Issac we concluded that we should use <br> line brakes to give the appearance of a new line. These paragraphs ensured better readability.

Amendments.html:
Worked on adding the text and annotations for the amendments I worked on into the js file and made edits to the button. I also worked on formatting this page to make sure the work that Issac and I did separately was in the same format and matched properly. While working on this Issac and I ran into some merging conflicts. This required us to toy around with GitHub from both our accounts and test it out till we were able to successfully merge.
