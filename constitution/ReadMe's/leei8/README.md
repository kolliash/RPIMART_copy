## Files Modified

amendments.js, all html files

## Changes Made

I researched the 14th-27th Amendments, and then wrote a write up about each of their histories and meanings. I then added each of them to the amendments.js file so that they would format correctly in html. I then made a pull request and fixed the merge conflict between my file and Ashrita's file.

I also changed the home.html file to index.html, and fixed links to the file.
