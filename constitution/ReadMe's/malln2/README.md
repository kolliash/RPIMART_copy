For this project I throughly annotated and analyzed each of the seven articles of the Constitution to provide a deeper understanding so we as RPI students know what each one is saying. I went over how the articles in the Consitution still affects our current laws and government and also gave real-life examples aswell. Furthermore, on the technical side I also fixed the article's page css and also linked the "The Consitution" title back to the home page. I also fixed up the history page as well adding a picture of the original Constitution and making the page better looking overall. Websites I use for the analysis is down below:
